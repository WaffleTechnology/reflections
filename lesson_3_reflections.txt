When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A good time to use a remote repository would be when you are a) working with multiple people on a repository, or b) when you are working on multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because if you are working with someone else and changes are constantly being made to the repository on GitHub then you might receive commits when you arent necessarily ready for it

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches exist as an alternate form of a repository. You can fork and clone branches. Clones is the local version of a repo on your own computer, whereas a fork is the online version of someone else's repo on your GitHub profile. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
The benefit comes from being able to have the latest copy available while you work on your own local changes, then being able to merge the changes together and push them to the remote.
